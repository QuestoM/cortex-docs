# SECTION 5: LONG-RUNNING BOT SCENARIOS (10 Detailed Workflows)

## Scenario 1: Bulk Ticket Triage (Overnight Processing of 100+ Tickets)

**Duration**: 4-6 hours (overnight batch)
**Trigger**: Scheduled job at 11 PM EST nightly, or manual trigger by SOC lead

**Full Workflow (22 steps)**:

1. **Query ticket backlog**: Bot queries the ticketing system API for all tickets with status "new" created in the last 24 hours. Retrieves full ticket metadata including subject, description, customer ID, timestamp, and any attachments.

2. **Enrich with customer context**: For each ticket, bot queries the CRM to pull customer profile data: subscription tier, health score, ARR, renewal date, VIP status, at-risk flags, and assigned CSM. This context is critical for prioritization.

3. **Classify ticket category**: Bot uses NLP to analyze ticket subject and description, classifying each into one of 15 categories: Security Incident, Vulnerability, Compliance, Integration, Agent Issue, Performance, Billing, Feature Request, Training, Account Change, API Help, Configuration, Documentation, General Inquiry, Platform Outage.

4. **Assess severity via keyword analysis**: Bot scans for urgency indicators: "breach," "ransomware," "down," "compliance deadline," "audit," "data leak," "outage." Cross-references with customer tier to determine if auto-escalation is warranted. Enterprise Critical tickets get instant escalation.

5. **Check for duplicate tickets**: Bot compares each new ticket against open tickets from the same customer using semantic similarity (title + description). If similarity score exceeds 85%, flag as potential duplicate and link to the original ticket. Do not auto-close -- flag for human review.

6. **Check customer's recent ticket history**: Bot queries the last 30 days of tickets for each customer. If a customer has submitted 3+ tickets on the same topic, flag as "recurring issue" and tag for root-cause analysis. If 5+ open tickets exist, flag as "support burden -- CSM attention needed."

7. **Apply SLA classification**: Based on customer tier and ticket severity, bot assigns SLA targets: Enterprise Critical = 15 min response / 2 hour resolution; Enterprise High = 1 hour / 8 hours; Mid-Market Critical = 30 min / 4 hours; Growth/Startup = 4 hours / 24 hours.

8. **Route to appropriate team**: Bot applies routing rules: Security Incidents go to Incident Response; Vulnerability issues go to Vulnerability Management; Integration failures go to Integrations team; Compliance to Compliance Engineering; Billing to Finance. Uses category + severity matrix.

9. **Auto-assign to available agents**: Bot checks agent availability matrix (shift schedules, current ticket load, skill set, timezone). Assigns tickets to agents with relevant expertise and lowest current load. Ensures no agent gets more than 8 active tickets.

10. **Generate auto-response for low-priority tickets**: For Low priority general inquiries, documentation feedback, and training requests, bot drafts a personalized acknowledgment email using customer's name and referencing relevant KB articles. Queue for human review before sending.

11. **Link relevant KB articles**: For each ticket, bot searches the knowledge base using the ticket's keywords and category. Attaches the top 3 most relevant KB articles to the ticket as "suggested resources." For common issues, drafts a solution summary.

12. **Identify upsell opportunities**: Bot flags tickets that suggest feature gaps addressable by higher tier subscriptions. E.g., customer asking about 24/7 monitoring on a Business tier -- flag as "upsell opportunity to Professional/Enterprise." Tag for sales team.

13. **Calculate priority score**: Bot computes a composite priority score (0-100) using weighted factors: severity (30%), customer ARR (20%), health score inverse (15%, lower health = higher priority), renewal proximity (15%), VIP/at-risk flags (10%), ticket age (10%).

14. **Generate escalation recommendations**: For any ticket with priority score > 80, bot creates an escalation recommendation with justification. For at-risk customers (health score < 70), all High+ tickets get auto-escalated to the CSM.

15. **Create incident links**: If multiple tickets from different customers reference the same issue (e.g., platform performance), bot creates an incident record linking all related tickets. Notifies the platform engineering team of potential systemic issue.

16. **Update ticket metadata**: Bot stamps each ticket with: assigned priority score, SLA deadline, assigned team, assigned agent, category, linked KB articles, duplicate flag, recurring flag, upsell flag. All machine-assigned fields tagged with "[AI-Assigned]" prefix.

17. **Generate triage summary report**: Bot compiles a summary report: total tickets processed, breakdown by severity/category/team, average priority score, escalated tickets list, at-risk customer tickets, SLA breach risks, duplicate tickets found, upsell opportunities identified.

18. **Send shift handoff briefing**: Bot composes and sends a shift-start briefing to the incoming morning SOC team. Includes: overnight ticket summary, high-priority tickets needing immediate attention, SLA deadlines approaching, and customer sentiment trends.

19. **Update customer health scores**: Based on ticket volume and severity, bot adjusts customer health scores. Customers submitting multiple Critical/High tickets get a health score penalty (-2 to -10 points depending on severity). Score updates logged with justification.

20. **Notify CSMs of at-risk activity**: For any customer whose health score dropped below 70, or who submitted 3+ tickets in the past week, bot sends a dedicated alert to the assigned CSM with context: recent tickets, health score trend, renewal date, and recommended actions.

21. **Log all actions in audit trail**: Every bot action (classification, routing, assignment, auto-response draft, escalation) is logged in an immutable audit trail with timestamp, confidence score, and reasoning. Enables human review of bot accuracy.

22. **Schedule follow-up checks**: Bot schedules automated follow-up checks: verify agent acknowledged assigned tickets within SLA window, check if auto-responses were approved and sent, and validate that escalated tickets received human attention. Follow-ups run every 2 hours.

---

## Scenario 2: Incident Response Coordination (Major Breach)

**Duration**: 8-24 hours (continuous operation during active incident)
**Trigger**: Critical security incident ticket with confirmed breach indicators

**Full Workflow (25 steps)**:

1. **Incident detection and initial triage**: Bot receives alert from AegisCloud platform indicating confirmed malicious activity. Parses alert details: affected assets, attack vector, IOCs (IP addresses, file hashes, domains), initial blast radius estimate, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

2. **Create incident record**: Bot creates a master incident record in the ticketing system with severity "Critical," unique incident ID, and initial timeline entry. Links the triggering alert(s) and sets incident status to "Active -- Containment Phase."

3. **Activate incident response team**: Bot queries the on-call schedule and sends immediate notifications to: Incident Commander (IC), Lead Analyst, Forensics Specialist, Communications Lead, and Customer's primary security contact. Uses SMS + phone for IC, Slack/email for others.

4. **Create war room channel**: Bot creates a dedicated Slack channel (#inc-YYYY-MM-DD-{short-name}), adds all IR team members, pins the incident summary, and sets channel topic with customer name, severity, and current status. Posts initial situation report.

5. **Pull customer context**: Bot retrieves customer profile from CRM: subscription tier, environment architecture, key contacts, previous incidents, compliance requirements, and special handling instructions (e.g., "FedRAMP -- US citizens only" for government clients).

6. **Query AegisCloud for related alerts**: Bot queries the last 72 hours of alerts for the affected customer, looking for precursor activity: failed logins, reconnaissance scanning, lateral movement indicators, data staging. Builds attack timeline with earliest detected activity.

7. **Perform IOC enrichment**: Bot takes all identified IOCs and enriches them against multiple threat intelligence sources: VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, internal threat intel database. Generates IOC report with reputation scores, known associations, and geographic data.

8. **Assess blast radius**: Bot queries asset inventory to identify all systems that communicated with compromised hosts in the past 30 days. Maps network topology to identify potential lateral movement paths. Creates a visual blast radius diagram with affected/potentially affected/safe categorization.

9. **Check for other affected customers**: Bot searches across the entire customer base for the same IOCs (IP addresses, file hashes, domains). If found in other customer environments, creates linked incidents and notifies those customers' CSMs. Cross-customer contamination is top priority.

10. **Draft initial customer communication**: Bot drafts initial customer notification email: what was detected, when, what actions are being taken, who is assigned, expected next update time. Includes factual information only, no speculation. Queued for IC approval before sending.

11. **Initiate containment actions**: Based on the incident type and approved playbook, bot triggers containment actions via AegisCloud API: isolate affected endpoints, block malicious IPs at firewall, disable compromised accounts, quarantine suspicious files. Logs all actions with timestamps.

12. **Monitor containment effectiveness**: Bot continuously monitors AegisCloud alerts for signs that containment is failing: new alerts from the same attack source, alerts on non-isolated systems, or communication attempts from isolated hosts. Reports status every 15 minutes to war room.

13. **Coordinate forensic evidence collection**: Bot triggers forensic data collection on affected systems: memory dumps, disk images, network packet captures, log bundles. Ensures chain of custody documentation is generated. Uploads to secure forensic evidence locker.

14. **Generate status updates on schedule**: Bot generates status updates every 30 minutes during active containment, every 2 hours during investigation phase. Each update includes: current status, actions taken since last update, findings, next steps, and updated timeline. Posts to war room and emails stakeholders.

15. **Check compliance notification requirements**: Based on customer's compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, etc.), bot determines regulatory notification requirements: who to notify, within what timeframe, using what format. Creates compliance notification checklist with deadlines.

16. **Draft regulatory notifications**: If breach notification is required, bot drafts notification letters for each relevant regulatory body using jurisdiction-specific templates. Includes incident details, scope of affected data, remediation steps, and contact information. Queued for legal review.

17. **Coordinate remediation actions**: As investigation reveals root cause, bot creates remediation tasks: patch vulnerable systems, rotate compromised credentials, update firewall rules, harden configurations. Assigns tasks to appropriate teams with priority and deadline.

18. **Track remediation completion**: Bot monitors each remediation task, sending reminders at 50% and 90% of SLA deadline. Escalates overdue tasks to the IC. Updates the incident record with completion percentages and remaining risk exposure.

19. **Perform post-containment verification**: After all containment and remediation actions are complete, bot runs verification checks: re-scan affected systems for IOCs, validate patches applied, confirm accounts properly rotated, verify network rules in place. Generates verification report.

20. **Generate post-incident report**: Bot compiles comprehensive incident report: executive summary, detailed timeline, affected assets/data, attack vector analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, response actions taken, root cause analysis, lessons learned, and recommended improvements.

21. **Update customer health score and CRM**: Bot updates customer health score based on incident severity and resolution quality. Adds incident summary to CRM notes. Flags account for executive review if breach was significant. Schedules post-incident review meeting with customer.

22. **Create follow-up tickets**: Bot creates follow-up tickets for: 30-day post-incident check, 90-day verification that remediation holds, detection rule improvements based on lessons learned, and any customer-requested enhancements to prevent recurrence.

23. **Update threat intelligence database**: Bot adds confirmed IOCs, TTPs, and attack patterns to AegisCloud's internal threat intelligence database. Creates detection rules for the attack pattern observed. Distributes threat intelligence bulletin to all potentially affected customers.

24. **Archive incident channel and evidence**: Bot archives the war room Slack channel, generates a complete transcript, and stores it with the incident record. Ensures all forensic evidence is properly cataloged and stored per retention policy.

25. **Conduct automated lessons-learned analysis**: Bot analyzes the incident response timeline to identify delays, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement. Compares response times against SLA targets. Generates improvement recommendations for the IR process. Schedules post-mortem meeting with all participants.

## Scenario 3: Quarterly Business Review Preparation

**Duration**: 3-5 hours
**Trigger**: Scheduled 2 weeks before each QBR meeting date

**Full Workflow (20 steps)**:

1. **Identify upcoming QBRs**: Bot queries the QBR schedule for all customers with meetings in the next 2 weeks. Retrieves customer profile, CSM assignment, and previous QBR presentation.

2. **Pull security metrics for the quarter**: For each customer, bot queries AegisCloud APIs for: total alerts generated, alerts by severity, incidents responded to, vulnerabilities discovered and remediated, compliance score trends, SLA compliance rates, and mean time to detect/respond.

3. **Calculate quarter-over-quarter trends**: Bot compares current quarter metrics against the previous quarter. Computes percentage change for key metrics. Identifies improving and declining areas. Generates trend charts and sparklines for the presentation.

4. **Pull ticket history and resolution data**: Bot retrieves all support tickets from the quarter: count, categories, resolution times, escalations, satisfaction scores. Identifies recurring issues and top support topics. Calculates support cost per customer.

5. **Analyze feature adoption**: Bot checks which AegisCloud features the customer is actively using vs. available in their tier. Calculates adoption percentage. Identifies underutilized features that could add value. Generates adoption heatmap.

6. **Review contract and commercial status**: Bot pulls contract details: current ARR, contract end date, renewal terms, expansion history, outstanding invoices, overage charges. Flags any billing issues that need to be resolved before QBR.

7. **Assess health score trajectory**: Bot retrieves health score history for the quarter. Identifies inflection points (sudden drops or improvements) and correlates with events (incidents, support tickets, feature releases). Generates health score timeline graph.

8. **Identify expansion opportunities**: Based on usage patterns, ticket requests (feature requests logged as tickets), and tier limitations, bot identifies potential upsell/cross-sell opportunities: higher tier, additional modules (OT, compliance, MSSP), more user seats, or extended retention.

9. **Generate competitive intelligence summary**: Bot checks CRM notes for any competitive mentions (customer evaluating alternatives). Prepares competitive positioning points and value reinforcement messaging relevant to the customer's industry.

10. **Compile risk register**: Bot creates a customer risk register: renewal risk (based on health score + satisfaction), competitive risk (based on CRM notes), technical risk (based on open critical tickets), compliance risk (based on upcoming audits), and budget risk (based on billing issues).

11. **Draft executive summary**: Bot drafts a one-page executive summary with: key achievements (incidents prevented, compliance milestones), challenges (major tickets, platform issues), metrics highlights, and recommendations for next quarter.

12. **Build presentation deck**: Bot generates a QBR presentation using the customer's branding template. Includes: agenda, security posture overview, metrics dashboard, incident summary, compliance status, feature adoption, ROI analysis, and roadmap preview.

13. **Create ROI analysis**: Bot calculates approximate ROI: estimated cost of breaches prevented (using industry average breach cost data), hours saved through automation, compliance penalty avoidance, and tool consolidation savings vs. previous vendor spend.

14. **Generate product roadmap preview**: Bot retrieves the public product roadmap and filters to features relevant to the customer's industry and use cases. Adds estimated release dates and highlights features the customer specifically requested.

15. **Draft CSM talking points**: Bot creates a talking point document for the CSM: conversation starters, sensitive topics to navigate (billing disputes, unresolved tickets), positive reinforcement points, and expansion discussion framing.

16. **Prepare customer-specific recommendations**: Based on the analysis, bot generates 3-5 actionable recommendations: configuration optimizations, training opportunities, feature rollouts, compliance improvements, and architecture enhancements.

17. **Schedule pre-QBR internal alignment**: Bot creates a calendar invite for the CSM, sales rep, and solutions architect for a 30-minute pre-QBR alignment meeting. Attaches all prepared materials and identifies decisions needed.

18. **Send customer QBR agenda and pre-read**: Bot drafts and sends (after CSM approval) a QBR agenda with a pre-read summary to the customer's attendee list. Includes discussion topics and requests input on topics the customer wants to cover.

19. **Generate comparison benchmarks**: Bot pulls anonymized industry benchmarks: how the customer's security metrics compare to peers of similar size and industry. Creates percentile rankings for key metrics.

20. **Set up post-QBR action tracking**: Bot creates a follow-up task list template to be populated during the QBR. Pre-populates with known action items from previous QBR and outstanding recommendations. Schedules post-QBR follow-up email for 24 hours after meeting.

---

## Scenario 4: Renewal Campaign Management

**Duration**: Ongoing (runs continuously for 90-day renewal window per customer)
**Trigger**: Customer renewal date is 90 days away

**Full Workflow (20 steps)**:

1. **Identify upcoming renewals**: Bot queries CRM for all customers with renewal dates in the next 90 days. Creates a renewal pipeline with columns: 90-day, 60-day, 30-day, 15-day, expired. Populates initial list with customer details, ARR, tier, health score, and assigned CSM.

2. **Segment customers by risk level**: Bot categorizes each renewal: Green (health score > 80, no open critical tickets, active usage), Yellow (health score 60-80, or some open issues), Red (health score < 60, at-risk flags, competitive threats, high ticket volume). Prioritizes outreach accordingly.

3. **Pull engagement metrics**: For each customer, bot retrieves: login frequency, feature usage breadth, alert response rate, support ticket satisfaction scores, event/webinar attendance, and community participation. Low engagement is a leading indicator of churn.

4. **Generate renewal health assessment**: Bot creates a comprehensive renewal health report for each customer: strengths (what's working well), risks (what could cause churn), opportunities (expansion potential), and recommended renewal strategy.

5. **Draft personalized outreach sequences**: For Green customers: thank you + auto-renewal confirmation email. For Yellow: value reinforcement + meeting request. For Red: executive sponsor engagement + rescue plan. Bot drafts all emails personalized with customer data and usage metrics.

6. **Schedule CSM outreach cadence**: Bot creates calendar reminders for CSMs: 90-day initial outreach, 75-day follow-up, 60-day renewal proposal, 45-day negotiation, 30-day decision checkpoint, 15-day escalation if unsigned. Adjusts cadence based on risk level.

7. **Generate renewal pricing proposals**: Bot prepares renewal quotes: standard renewal at current pricing, multi-year discount options (5% for 2-year, 10% for 3-year), and expansion bundle pricing. Applies any approved promotional pricing. Routes for manager approval if discount exceeds 15%.

8. **Identify at-risk signals in real-time**: Throughout the 90-day window, bot continuously monitors for churn signals: support ticket spike, login frequency drop, champion leaving company (LinkedIn monitoring), competitor mentions in tickets, billing disputes. Alerts CSM immediately.

9. **Create rescue plans for Red accounts**: For at-risk renewals, bot drafts a detailed rescue plan: executive sponsor outreach, free training sessions, dedicated support engineer for 30 days, feature preview access, and commercial concessions within approved limits.

10. **Track competitor evaluations**: Bot monitors ticket content and meeting notes for competitor mentions. If a customer is evaluating alternatives, bot prepares competitive battle card with feature comparison, migration costs, and risk analysis of switching.

11. **Coordinate internal stakeholders**: Bot notifies sales, finance, and executive team of high-value renewals. For accounts > $100K ARR, bot schedules executive sponsor call. For at-risk accounts > $50K ARR, bot triggers the save desk process.

12. **Generate renewal contract documents**: Once verbal agreement is reached, bot generates the renewal contract using approved templates. Pre-fills customer details, pricing, term dates, and any negotiated terms. Routes through legal review for non-standard terms.

13. **Send automated reminder sequences**: For customers who haven't responded, bot sends escalating reminders: friendly check-in (day 75), formal reminder (day 60), urgency note with feature comparison (day 45), final notice (day 30), executive escalation (day 15).

14. **Track renewal progress in pipeline**: Bot updates the renewal pipeline dashboard in real-time. Shows conversion rates by segment, forecasted renewable ARR, at-risk ARR, and lost ARR. Sends weekly pipeline summary to VP of Customer Success.

15. **Handle early renewal requests**: For customers wanting to renew early (to lock in pricing or align with fiscal year), bot processes the request: calculates pro-rated charges, generates updated contract, and applies any early renewal incentives.

16. **Process renewal signatures**: Bot monitors for signed contracts. Upon receipt, updates CRM, triggers billing system for new term, sends confirmation to customer, and notifies CSM. For auto-renewals, confirms 30 days before auto-renewal date.

17. **Execute post-renewal onboarding**: After renewal, bot creates a "renewal welcome" sequence: new feature introduction, updated training schedule, CSM meeting request for Q1 planning, and customer satisfaction survey.
